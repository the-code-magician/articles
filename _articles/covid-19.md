# Introduction

In the beginning of 2020, the world became the stage for a large scientific, social and economical experiment.
On the 31st December, 2019 cases of a pneumonia with unknown cause were reported in Wuhan, capital of the Hubei province in China. The virus, later identified as a SARS-Cov-2, causes the COVID-19 disease.

Due to the lack of a vaccine, governments applied non-pharmaceutical intererventions (NPIs) to slow the spread of the virus. Among these interventions, we find common terms from every-day news, such as social distancing, personal protective equipment, increase of medical staff or contact tracing. In this article, we will explain the different measurements.

These measures have been implemented to different extents with different time periods accross different countries. These measures have deep economical impacts in the society and have been criticized due to the lact of scientific evidence supporting their effictiveness.

# SARS-Cov-2

Severe acute respiratory syndrom (SARS) is a viral respiratory disease associated with [coronavirus](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus). The disease caused by coronavirus can lead to severe respiratory problems, including shortness of breath and pneumonia.

This strain, SARS-Cov-2, was identified as the the cause of the outbreak of pneumonia in China. The genetic sequence is publicly available [online](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sars-cov-2/).

# COVID-19 symptoms and transmission

The infection by SARS-Cov-2 can lead to three outcomes:
1. Assymptomatic infection - no symptoms of the disease;
2. Mild symptoms, including headache, fever, cought, loss of taste and smell, among others;
3. Severe disease that leads to shortness of breath, difficult breathing and in the worst cases, death.

# Non-pharmaceutical interventions

## Social distancing

Social distancing means keeping a safe space between individuals who are not from the same household.

## Lockdowns

A lockdown is the requirement for people to stay where they are. They are applied to keep people from moving around in situations when movement can put people at risk. In the context of the pandemic, the [lockdown helps minimizing the contact between people](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/1284).

The lockdowns are applied in different extents across countries, with stay-at-home orders, curfews, working from home, etc.) Shutdowns of shops, business and services help preventing the gathering of people and are part of the lockdown measures.

## Personal protective equipment and increased sanitary measures

The personal protective equipment is the equipemnt worn to minimize the exposure to hazards. This include face masks, face shields, gloves, aprons, etc. They are meant to keep the virus from reaching the nose, month and eyes. In many countries, it became mandatory to use face masks in public areas (mostly indoors).

### Wahsing the hands, alcohol gel and other desinfectants

One way of spreading the virus is through contact with droplets in contaminated surfaces. [We touch our faces unwilingly several times a day](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/1334). By doing that, [we move particles from surfaces to the eyes, mouth and nose](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/1333). By washing our the hands oftenly, [we prevent the spread of COVID-19](https://socratrees.azurewebsites.net/statement/details/331). 

In many places, it is now common to find alcohol gel dispensers (or other kind of alcohol based desinfectant). 

## Contact tracing

## Increased medical staff

# Overall effictivness of NPIs

The most effective interventions are curfews, closing schools, restaurants and shops, and working from home. These lockdown measures [can be more effective if applied earlier](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/1283).
