# Introduction

In the beginning of 2020, the world became the stage for a large scientific, social and economical experiment.
On the 31st December, 2019 cases of a pneumonia with unknown cause were reported in Wuhan, capital of the Hubei province in China. The virus, later identified as a SARS-Cov-2, causes a the COVID-19 disease.

Due to the lack of a vaccine, governments applied non-pharmaceutical intererventions (NPIs) to slow the spread of the virus. The interventions consist of social distancing, personal protective gear, increase of medical staff, contact tracing, among others. In this article, we will explain the different measurements.

These measures have been implemented to different extents with different time periods accross different countries. These measures have deep economical impacts in the society and have been criticized due to the lact of scientific evidence supporting their effictiveness.

# SARS-Cov-2

Severe acute respiratory syndrom (SARS) is a viral respiratory disease associated with [coronavirus](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus). The disease caused by coronavirus can lead to severe respiratory problems, including shortness of breath and pneumonia.

This strain, SARS-Cov-2, was identified as the the cause of the outbreak of pneumonia in China. The genetic sequence is publicly available [online](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sars-cov-2/).

# COVID-19 symptoms and transmission

The infection by SARS-Cov-2 can lead to three outcomes:
1. Assymptomatic infection - no symptoms of the disease;
2. Mild symptoms, including headache, fever, cought, loss of taste and smell, among others;
3. Severe disease that leads to shortness of breath, difficult breathing and in the worst cases, death.

# Non-pharmaceutical interventions

## Social distancing

## Personal protective gear

## Contact tracing

## Increased medical staff

## Protective material

# Overall effictivness of NPIs

The most effective interventions are curfews, closing schools, restaurants and shops, and working from home. These lockdown measures [can be more effective if applied earlier](https://socratrees.azurewebsites.net/statement/1283/during-a-pandemic,-early-lockdown-measures-save-a-lot-of-lifes).
